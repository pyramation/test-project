## Developing

This module was generated with `pgpm init`. For a complete guide on creating and testing database modules, see [Creating Your First Module](https://constructive.io/learn/modular-postgres/creating-first-module).

```sh
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Deploy to a database
pgpm deploy --database your_db --createdb --yes
```

## Auditing

The workspace audits this module's schema together with every other module in
`packages/`, from the workspace root — there is nothing to configure here:

```sh
# From the workspace root: deploys every module into an ephemeral database and
# scans its catalog (security + performance grades)
pnpm run audit:db
```

The gates and the exposed surface to grade against live in the workspace's
`safegres.config.js`; see the workspace README for the rest.
