## Getting Started

This workspace was generated with `pgpm init workspace`. For a complete guide on developing with pgpm workspaces, see [Workspaces: Organize Postgres](https://constructive.io/learn/modular-postgres/workspaces-organize-postgres).

### Quick Start

```sh
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start PostgreSQL (requires Docker) and load its connection variables.
# Already running your own PostgreSQL? Skip both lines and export
# PGHOST/PGPORT/PGUSER/PGPASSWORD for a superuser instead.
pgpm docker start
eval "$(pgpm env)"

# Create a module
pgpm init

# Navigate to your module and run tests
cd packages/your-module
pnpm test:watch

# Audit every module's schema (security + performance grades, see safegres.config.js)
pnpm run audit:db
```

### Auditing

[safegres](https://www.npmjs.com/package/safegres) grades the schema this workspace
deploys on two independent axes — security (grants, RLS, policy coverage and behavior)
and performance (predicates no index can serve, per-row function calls, foreign keys
without a covering index). It runs from the workspace root and needs no configuration
per module: every module under `packages/` is deployed into one ephemeral database and
that catalog is scanned, so a module joins the audit the moment `pgpm init` creates it.

```sh
# Audit: deploys every module into an ephemeral database and scans its catalog
pnpm run audit:db

# Accept today's performance findings as debt, so CI gates only on new ones
pnpm run audit:db:baseline

# Audit a database you already have instead
pnpm exec safegres audit --database your_db
```

The gates and the exposed surface to grade against live in `safegres.config.js`;
the run also writes JSON, markdown and SARIF reports to `safegres-reports/`.
`safegres-perf-baseline.json` starts empty and is committed — it is the accepted
performance debt, and the only audit file that carries state. CI runs the same audit
as a single `Database audit (safegres)` job.

Declaring `exposure` in the config is the first thing worth doing: until the audit
knows which schemas and roles your API reaches it has to assume the whole database
is, and caps the score at the `B` the gate allows.

### Using your own PostgreSQL

`pgpm docker start` is a convenience, not a requirement. If PostgreSQL (17+) is already
running on your machine, point pgpm at it and carry on — nothing else changes:

```sh
export PGHOST=localhost PGPORT=5432 PGUSER=postgres PGPASSWORD=yourpassword
pgpm admin-users bootstrap --yes   # once: creates the roles pgpm and tests expect
```

Don't run `eval "$(pgpm env)"` in that case: it prints the Docker container's defaults
(`postgres`/`password` on `localhost:5432`) and would overwrite yours. If you want the
Docker container *alongside* an existing server, give it another port and match it:
`pgpm docker start --port 5433` then `export PGPORT=5433`.

### Install scripts

`pnpm install` never asks you to approve build scripts here: every dependency that
wants to run code at install time already has a decision in `pnpm-policy.yaml`. If a
new dependency stops the install with `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`, add it there — under
`allowBuilds` with a reason if it truly needs its script, or as `false` if it does not —
and run `pnpm run policy`. Don't use `pnpm approve-builds`; it writes outside the
managed block and `pnpm run policy:check` will fail.

### Working with an AI agent

`pgpm init workspace` installed the `pgpm` skill at `.agents/skills/pgpm/` — a guide to
pgpm's commands, the deploy/revert/verify pattern, plan files, dependencies, testing, and
CI. Agents that read `.agents/skills/` (Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, opencode, ...) pick it
up automatically; see [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).

For an agent that looks elsewhere — Claude Code reads `.claude/skills/` — either point it
at `.agents/skills/pgpm/SKILL.md` directly, or install the skill into the location it
expects:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/constructive-io/constructive --skill pgpm
```

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm
- Docker, or a local PostgreSQL 17+ you have superuser credentials for
- PostgreSQL client tools (`psql`)
- pgpm (`npm install -g pgpm`)

See [Prerequisites](https://constructive.io/learn/quickstart/prerequisites) for detailed setup instructions.
